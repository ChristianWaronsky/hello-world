# hello-world
# Program Purpose
   This program will ask for your name and something. It will then print out something in all uppercase letters and ask you why you are yelling. 

# Installation and Use
   First, clone the github repository that can be found here: https://github.com/ChristianWaronsky/hello-world. You can do this by pressing the drop down box labeled "code" and cloning/downloaded in your desired fashion. Any problems you may run into you could likely find on https://discourse.jupyter.org/c/jupyterlab. Or you may ask a question there as well. 
   Next, open "something.py" and run the code. It will prompt your for your name, so enter it, and it will prompt you for something, so enter something. It will capitalize something and print it out followed by nine exclamation points. It will finally ask you why you are yelling.
   We used the unliscensed liscense because we allow and encourage users to do whatever they want with our repository.
